# cassafortinator
An award-winning Arduino Project!


## What is cassafortinator?
Cassafortinator is a project developed by a group of three (including me!) during the Arduino week at the Como Summer School 2025. It's a safe that features two minigames: 
- Guess The Code: a random code of 8 will be generated. You have two buttons that you have to press in the right order; you fail, you restart.
- Guess The Color: an RGB LED will show a color that you will have to reproduce using three potentiometers (Red, Green, Blue).
When both games are solved, the safe will unlock and can be opened. In the original project, inside the safe there was an Arch Linux installation medium (i use arch btw).

## What does *cassafortinator* mean?
Initially we wanted to call it *cassaforte*, the italian translation of *safe*, but the Summer School's organizers asked us (all of the participants) to be original with our projects' name. So we decided to call it *cassaofortinator* as a tribute to [Dr. Doofenshmirtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Heinz_Doofenshmirtz), as it's a diabolical way to open a safe.

## What is this all about?
It's not a mind-blowing project per se, but the fact that we created this in around 8 hours from scratch and from knowledge acquired in 24 hours I personally think that it's good enough. And it's not just about the project: it's about team work, as I didn't build it myself, but with other guys my age. It's a process of personal growth through new friendship and teamwork.

## What does it look like?
It's a box. Like, a cardboard box, put up using paper tape. 

## What does it feature?
- Arduino Uno R3;
- Three potentiometers as knobs;
- 16x2 LCD;
- Buttons.

## What does the circuit look like?
It looks like this:
